🧘 **Yoga Posture Detection Using Mediapipe**

This project implements a yoga posture detection system using Python and Google's Mediapipe framework. It first extracts body landmarks from yoga pose images and trains a model, which is then used to detect and display the name of the yoga posture in real-time using live webcam input.

🧠 **Project Overview**

* Extracts body landmarks from yoga pose images using Mediapipe.
* Uses the collected data to train a machine learning model.
* Captures real-time video via webcam for live pose detection.
* Predicts and displays the yoga pose using the trained model.


🧰 **Technologies Used**

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** – For video capture and display.
- **Mediapipe** – For body pose estimation.
- **NumPy** – For landmark coordinate calculations.

🚀 **How to Run**

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
3. Run the notebook Yoga.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE.
4. Allow webcam access when prompted

✨ **Features**

* Real-time yoga pose tracking
* Uses Mediapipe’s robust body tracking model
* Can be extended with more poses or accuracy checks
* Fun and interactive — great for learning or demo projects

📌 **Future Improvements**

* Add more yoga poses.
* Integrate feedback scoring (accuracy %).
* Include voice or text-based correction suggestions.
* Add GUI for user-friendly interaction.
